Kantan (簡単) - An Anki plugin for Japanese learners.
==================

Kantan adds native japanese definitions and images to your japanese sentence cards. It also optionally adds english definitions as well. 

This plugin makes inputting Japanese sentences into Anki much less tedious. It goes along really well with the Japanese Support plugin. This plugin also assumes your cards are structured similar to how the Japanese Support plugin would want the cards structured. (e.g. Expression, Meaning, Reading, Audio, Image)

If you want the english definitions as well, please add a field to your deck named "EnglishMeaning"

Bold the word
-------------

Bold the word you want the definition of in the editor

The plugin will add a Japanese definition and an image to your card after losing focus.

Button for optional english definitions
-------------

Click the "英" button in the upper right hand corner of the editor.

For concrete concepts usually the image and the japanese definition is enough, but sometimes an english definition is needed. I created a button for this insteading of making it automatic because I want to go to Japanese-Japanese definitions as quickly as possible.
